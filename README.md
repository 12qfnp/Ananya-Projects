The Dashboard_Links file in this GitHub repository provides access to the Power BI dashboards that my team and I developed for SVKM's International School. These dashboards include a Syllabus Tracker, which helps monitor syllabus completion across different classes and sections, and a House-Wise Performance Dashboard, which offers insights into student performance in various houses (Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, and Topaz). Designed to enhance data-driven decision-making, these tools provide an interactive and structured way to assess academic progress and student achievements and We have used their syllabus data to develop and I cannot upload the data we have used to develop this dasboard as per some security concerns
